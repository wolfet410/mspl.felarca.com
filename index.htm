            <p>
              The Mutated Seabass Poker League (MSPL) began with its first full season
              in 2006. The league plays no-limit poker tournaments of Texas Hold'em, 
              Omaha, 7-Card Stud, and Crazy Pineapple. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              Over 100 people have participated in the league during its history. Each
              poker game generally has between 15 and 25 players.
            </p>
            <p>
              We keep statistics on each player throughout the season.  There are 16 
              games throughout a season that count for points, with only 11 counting 
              towards your point total to give players the ability to miss games without 
              hurting their total points standings.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The player with the most points and the player with the most knockouts are 
              paid an additional money prize at the end of the season.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are 3 different tournament types throughout a season: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Regular - The normal $15 game, points count at their face value
                </li>
                <li>
                  Major - There are 3 Majors with a slightly higher buy-in at $25 spread out 
                  throughout the season, points count at 1.5 times their value
                </li>
                <li>
                  Main Event -  The final points game of the season, with a $50 buy-in, 
                  points count at double their value
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              The 17th game of the season is the MSPL Invitational, played at the end of 
              the season by the 8 players in the league with the most league points.

          <p>*The following rule changes may be adjusted during the first few tournaments of the 2013/2014 season.
          <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-inset="false">
            <h4>Chip Stacks</h4>
            <p>
              All Regular and Major tournaments will use 800 chips.  The breakdown is:<br />
              5 x Black 100's = 500<br />
              9 x Green 25's = 225<br />
              13 x Red 5's = 65<br />
              10 x Blue 1's = 10<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The Main Event will use 1,000 chips.  2 x Black 100's will be added to each stack for the Main Event.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-inset="false">
            <h4>Rabbit Hunt Chip</h4>
            <p>
              One rabbit hunt chip per player may be purchased during the buy-in for $1.  The chip can be turned into the
              dealer to rabbit hunt a hand through the river. The chip is only valid at the tournament it was purchased for,
              a rabbit hunt chip cannot be carried over to the next tournament.
            </p>
            <p>
              The money earned from selling rabbit hunt chips will be added to the tournament's league donation fund.
            </p>
            <p>
              *The rabbit hunt chip will begin on a trial basis, and may not be available at all tournaments.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-inset="false">
            <h4>Balancing Tables</h4>
            <p>
              If the difference in the number of players between two tables is 3 (or more), one player from the table 
              with the most players will move to the table with the fewest players.  The move occurs immediately after
              the knock out that unbalanced the tables. The clock may or may not be stopped while the player moves; however
              every reasonable effort will be made to ensure the player moving does not miss out on a hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              *There implementation of this new rule may change during the first few games of the 2013/2014 season.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-inset="false">
            <h4>Eliminate Race In Color-up</h4>
            <p>
              We will no longer race off the chips during the color-up at each break. Players will still stack their 
              chips in stacks that match the appropriate larger denomination, but any extra chips will be rounded up.
              Players will not lose chips during a color-up
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-inset="false">
            <h4>Dead Hand</h4>
            <p>
              To increase consistency, and better match traditional casino and tournament rules, if a player is not seated 
              his hand will be considered folded as soon as the last card in the initial deal is dealt to the dealer button.
              The hand will no longer be alive until the action reaches the unseated player.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the cards of any player that leaves his seat in the middle of a hand will immediately be
              folded, regardless of where the action is in the hand.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-inset="false">
            <h4>Dead Stacks</h4>
            <p>
              If a player buys in to a tournament and is not playing, or leaves the venue in the middle of the tournament, the 
              player's dead stack will be removed from play after two breaks pass. Dead stack players will be considered 
              knocked out at the beginning of the 2nd break. The passage of two breaks determines when the dead stacks
              are removed from the table. If a player leaves in the middle of the tournament, the player will be considered
              knocked out at the start of the 2nd break after the player leaves the venue regardless of how many minutes
              have actually passed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dead stack receives cards (that are immediately folded when the deal completes, see the Dead Hand rule) 
              until the dead stack is removed from the table.
            </p>
            <p>
                No other player will receive the point for the knock out, unless the dead stack player was actually knocked 
                out.  Dead stack players will receive the correct number of points for the position their dead stack was
                removed from play.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-inset="false">
            <h4>Invitational Players</h4>
            <p>
              If a player in the Top 8 cannot make the invitational the 9th place player will be allowed to play.
              However, the missing Top 8 player will still be paid out 8th place money from the 9th place player's
              winnings. If the 9th place player isn't available to play, the same deal is offered to the 10th place 
              player, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              This keeps 8 players in the Invitational, while still giving the person who placed in the Top 8 a prize.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-inset="false">
            <h4>Invitational Seating Order</h4>
            <p>
              The players placement in the league determines their placement at the Invitational
              table. The player holding 1st place in the league will sit in seat #1, 2nd place in 
              seat #2, and so on.
