(A straddle bet sets a new minimum bring-in, and is not treated as a raise.) The minimum bet remains the same amount on all betting rounds. </li><li> A wager is not binding until the chips are actually released into the pot, unless the player has made a verbal statement of action. </li><li> If there is a discrepancy between a player's verbal statement and the amount put into the pot, the bet will be corrected to the verbal statement. </li><li> If a call is short due to a counting error, the amount must be corrected, even if the bettor has shown down a superior hand. </li><li> Because the amount of a wager at big-bet poker has such a wide range, a player who has taken action based on a gross misunderstanding of the amount wagered needs some protection. A &quot;call&quot; may be ruled not binding if it is obvious that the player grossly misunderstood the amount wagered. A bettor should not show down a hand until the amount put into the pot for a call seems reasonably correct, or it is obvious that the caller understands the amount wagered. The decision-maker is allowed considerable discretion in ruling on this type of situation. A possible rule-of-thumb is to disallow any claim of not understanding the amount wagered if the caller has put eighty percent or more of that amount into the pot.<br> Example: On the end, a player puts a $500 chip into the pot and says softly, &ldquo;Four hundred.&rdquo; The opponent puts a $100 chip into the pot and says, &ldquo;Call.&rdquo; The bettor immediately shows the hand. The dealer says, &ldquo;He bet four hundred.&rdquo; The caller says, &ldquo;Oh, I thought he bet a hundred.&rdquo; In this case, the recommended ruling normally is that the bettor had an obligation to not show the hand when the amount put into the pot was obviously short, and the &ldquo;call&rdquo; can be retracted. Note that the character of each player can be a factor. (Unfortunately, situations can arise at big-bet poker that are not so clear-cut as this.) </li><li> A bet of a single chip without comment is considered to be the full amount of the chip. However, a player acting on a previous bet with a larger denomination chip is calling the previous bet unless this player makes a verbal declaration to raise the pot. </li><li> If a player tries to bet less than the legal minimum and has more chips, the wager must be increased to the proper size. The wager is brought up to the sufficient amount only, no greater size. </li><li> All wagers may be required to be in the same denomination of chip (or larger) used for the minimum bring-in, even if smaller chips are used in the blind structure. If this is done, the smaller chips do not play except in quantity, even when going all-in. </li><li> The house has the right to place a maximum time limit for taking action on your hand. The clock may be put on someone by the dealer as directed by a member of league management, if a player requests it. If the clock is put on you when you are facing a bet, you will have thirty seconds to act on your hand. You will have a ten-second warning, after which your hand is dead if you have not acted. </li><li> The cardroom does not condone &quot;insurance&quot; or any other &ldquo;proposition&rdquo; wagers. The management will decline to make decisions in such matters, and the pot will be awarded to the best hand. Players are asked to refrain from instigating proposition wagers in any form. </li></ol></body></html>
