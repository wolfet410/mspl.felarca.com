Any delay may affect the ruling. </li><li> If an incorrect rule interpretation or decision by the league management or any dealer is made in good faith, the league has no liability. </li><li> A ruling may be made regarding a pot if it has been requested before the next deal starts. Otherwise, the result of a deal must stand. The first riffle of the shuffle marks the start for a deal. </li><li> If a pot has been incorrectly awarded and mingled with chips that were not in the pot, and the time limit for a ruling request given in the previous rule has been observed, the league management may determine how much was in the pot by reconstructing the betting, and then transfer that amount to the proper player. </li><li> The same action may have a different meaning, depending on who does it, so the possible intent of an offender will be taken into consideration. Some factors here are the person&rsquo;s amount of poker experience and past record. </li></ol><h5> PROCEDURES </h5><ol><li> The league management will decide when to start or close any game. </li><li> Collections (seat rental fees) are paid in advance. In all time-collection games, the dealer is required to pick up the collection from each player before dealing. </li><li> Cash is not permitted on the table. All cash should be changed into chips in order to play. </li><li> Chips may not be removed when leaving the table unless moving to another table. </li><li> All chips must be kept in plain view. Awareness of the amount being in play for each opponent is an important part of poker. </li><li> Playing out of a rack is not allowed. </li><li> Only one person may play a hand. </li><li> No one is allowed to play another player&rsquo;s chips. </li><li> Pushing an ante or posting for another person is not allowed except for the dealer posting for an absent player. </li><li> Players must keep their cards in full view. This means above table-level and not past the edge of the table. The cards should not be covered by the hands in a manner to completely conceal them. </li><li> Any player is entitled to a clear view of an opponent&rsquo;s chips. Higher denomination chips should be easily visible. </li><li> Looking through the discards or deck stub is not allowed. </li><li> After a deal ends, dealers are asked to not show what card would have been dealt. </li><li> A player is expected to pay attention to the game and not hold up play. Activity that interferes with this such as reading at the table is discouraged, and the player will be asked to cease if a problem is caused. </li><li> A non-player may sit at the table at the discretion of the dealer. </li><li> Speaking a foreign language during a deal is not allowed. </li></ol><h5> SEATING </h5><ol><li> It is the player&rsquo;s responsibility to be in the playing area and hear the list being called. </li><li> A player may not hold a seat in more than one game. </li><li> When a button game starts, active players will draw a card for the button position. The button will be awarded to the highest card by rank and then by suit for all games. </li></ol></body></html>
