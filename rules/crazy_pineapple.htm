<p> Crazy Pineapple is similar to Hold&rsquo;em in using a three-cardflop on the board, a fourth boardcard, and then a fifth boardcard. Each player is dealt three holecards(instead of two) at the start. The betting is the same as in hold'em, using a preflop, flop, turn,and river betting rounds. However, after the betting round following the flop, each remaining playermust discard one of their holecards. In order to make a hand, a player can use any combination of fivecards between the five community cards and their two holecards. At the showdown, the entire two-cardhand should be shown to receive the pot. </p>
<p>A dealer button is used. Crazy Pineapple is played with a small and a big blind in play. Crazy Pineapple will use the small blind / big blind  schedule as listed in the General League Information.</p>
