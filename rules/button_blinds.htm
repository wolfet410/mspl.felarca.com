A round disk called the button is used to indicate which player has the dealer position. The player with the button is last to receive cards on the initial deal and has the right of last action after the first betting round. The button moves clockwise after a deal ends to rotate the advantage of last action. One or more blind bets are usually used to stimulate action and initiate play. Blinds are posted before the players look at their cards. Blinds are part of a player&rsquo;s bet (unless a certain structure or situation specifies otherwise). With two blinds, the small blind is posted by the first player clockwise from the button, and the big blind is posted by the player two positions clockwise from the button. Action is initiated on the first betting round by the first player to the left of the blinds. On all subsequent betting rounds, the action begins with the first active player to the left of the button. </p><h5><strong>RULES FOR USING BLINDS </strong></h5><ol><li>The minimum bring-in and allowable raise sizes for the opener are specified by the poker form used and blind amounts set for a game. They remain the same even when the player in the blind does not have enough chips to post the full amount. </li><li> Each round every player must get an opportunity for the button. The button always moves forward to the next player and the blinds adjust accordingly. </li><li> A player posting a blind in the game&rsquo;s regular structure has the option of raising the pot at the first turn to act. Although chips posted by the big blind are considered a bet, this option to raise is retained if someone goes all-in with a wager of less than the minimum raise. </li><li> In heads-up play with two blinds, the small blind is on the button. </li><li> No player can receive the big blind twice in a row. In the case that the normal rotation of the button would cause a player to have the big blind twice in a row, the button will advance one player to its left and the blinds will be placed accordingly. </li><li> When you post the big blind, it serves as your opening bet. When it is your next turn to act, you have the option to raise. </li></ol></body></html>
