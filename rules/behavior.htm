We have established a code of conduct, and may deny the use of our cardroom to violators. The following are not permitted: </p><ol><li> Collusion with another player or any other form of cheating. </li><li> Verbally or physically threatening any participant. </li><li> Using excessive profanity or obscene language. </li><li> Creating a disturbance by arguing, shouting, or making excessive noise. </li><li> Throwing, tearing, bending, or crumpling cards. </li><li> Destroying or defacing property. </li><li> Using an illegal substance. </li><li> Carrying a weapon. </li></ol><h5> POKER ETIQUETTE </h5><p> The following actions are improper, and grounds for warning, suspending, or barring a violator: </p><ol><li> Deliberately acting out of turn. </li><li> Deliberately splashing chips into the pot. </li><li> Agreeing to check a hand out when a third player is all-in. </li><li> Reading a hand for another player at the showdown before it has been placed faceup on the table. </li><li> Telling anyone to turn a hand faceup at the showdown. </li><li> Revealing the contents of a live hand in a multihanded pot before the betting is complete. Revealing the contents of a folded hand before the betting is complete.

Cards should be released in a low line of flight, at a moderate rate of speed (not at the dealer's hands or chip-rack). </li><li> Stacking chips in a manner that interferes with dealing or viewing cards. </li><li> Making statements or taking action that could unfairly influence the course of play, whether or not the offender is involved in the pot. </li><li> Using a cell phone at the table. </li></ol><h5> TOBACCO USE </h5><p> Smoking is not allowed in the cardroom. </p></body></html>
