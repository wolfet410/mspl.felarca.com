Each player is dealt four holecards (instead of two) at the start. In order to make a hand, a player must use precisely two holecards with three boardcards. The betting is the same as in hold'em, using a preflop, flop, turn, and river betting rounds. At the showdown, the entire four-card hand should be shown to receive the pot. </p>
<p>A dealer button is used. Omaha is played with a small and a big blind in play. Omaha will use the small blind / big blind  schedule as listed in the General League Information.</p>
<h5> RULES OF OMAHA </h5><ol><li> All the rules of Hold&rsquo;em apply to Omaha except the rule on playing the board, which is not possible in Omaha (because you must use two cards from your hand and three cards from the board). </li></ol></body></html>
