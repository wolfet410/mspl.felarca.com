There are then three more upcards and a final downcard, with a betting round after each, for a total of five betting rounds on a deal played to the showdown. The best five-card poker hand wins the pot. Deliberately changing the order of your upcards in a stud game is improper because it unfairly misleads the other players. </p>
<p>Only the dealer button is used. Antes are collected from every player at the table before each hand is dealt. Seven-card stud will use the ante / minimum bet schedule as listed in the General League Information.</p>
<h5> RULES OF SEVEN-CARD STUD </h5><ol><li>If your first or second holecard is accidentally turned up by the dealer, a misdeal is called. </li><li>For all  betting rounds, the high hand on board initiates the action (a tie is broken by position, with the player who received cards first acting first). </li><li> If the player with the high hand is all-in, the person to that player&rsquo;s left acts first. </li>
<li> When the wrong person is designated as high and acts, if the next player has not yet acted, the action will be corrected to the real high hand, who now must act. The incorrect bettor takes back their action. If the next hand has acted after the incorrect high hand action, the action stands, action continues from there, and the real high hand has no obligations. </li><li>If you are not present at the table when it is your turn to act on your hand, the hand will be killed when the betting reaches your seat and your ante will be forfeit. </li><li> If you pick up your upcards without calling when facing a wager, this is a fold and your hand is dead. This act has no significance at the showdown because betting is over; the hand is live until discarded. </li><li> A card dealt off the table is treated as an exposed card. </li><li> The dealer announces the the high hand, all raises, and all pairs. Dealers do not announce possible straights or flushes. </li><li> If the dealer burns two cards for one round or fails to burn a card, the cards will be corrected, if at all possible, to their proper positions. If this should happen on a final downcard, and either a card intermingles with a player's other holecards or a player looks at the card, the player must accept that card. </li><li> If the dealer burns and deals one or more cards before a round of betting has been completed, the card(s) must be eliminated from play. After the betting for that round is completed, an additional card for each remaining player still active in the hand is also eliminated from play (to later deal the same cards to the players who would have received them without the error). After that round of betting has concluded, the dealer burns a card and play resumes. The removed cards are held off to the side in the event the dealer runs out of cards. If the prematurely dealt card is the final downcard and has been looked at or intermingled with the player's other holecards, the player must keep the card, and on sixth street betting may not bet or raise (because the player now has all seven cards). </li>
<li>If there are not enough cards left in the deck for all players to receive a fresh card,  then the dealer announces to the table that a common card will be used. The dealer will burn a card and turn one card faceup in the center of the table as a common card that plays in everyone&rsquo;s hand. If there is only one card remaining in the stub, the dealer will mix the remaining card with the burn cards and any cards removed from the deck by the previous rule. The player who is now high using the common card initiates the action for the last round. </li>
<li> An all-in player should receive holecards dealt facedown, but if the final holecard to such a player is dealt faceup, the card must be kept, and the other players receive their normal card. </li><li> If the dealer turns the last card faceup to any player, the hand now high on the board using all the upcards will start the action. The following rules apply to the dealing of cards: <ol type="a">  <li> (a) If there are more than two players, all remaining players receive their last card facedown. A player whose last card is faceup has the option of acting before betting action starts. </li><li> (b) If there are only two players remaining and the first player's final downcard is dealt faceup, the second player's final downcard will also be dealt faceup, and the betting proceeds as normal. In the event the first player's final card is dealt facedown and the opponent's final card is dealt faceup, the player with the faceup final card has the option of acting before betting action starts. </li></ol></li><li> A hand with more than seven cards is dead. A hand with less than seven cards at the showdown is dead, except any player missing a seventh card may have the hand ruled live. </li><li> A player who calls a bet even though beaten by an opponent&rsquo;s upcards is not entitled to a refund. (The caller receives information about the opponent that is not available for free.) </li></ol>
