The questions that will be posed are below. Only players that participate in the tournament can vote on the tournament's future within the league. If a tournament is voted on to be removed or reduced, removed occurances of that tournament will be replaced with Texas Hold'em. Currently there are 4 occurances of Omaha and 3 occurances of 7-Card Stud on the schedule. </p><p>Note: The following questions will be worded the same for 7-Card Stud except for the game type named and the number of tournaments.</p><p>1.
